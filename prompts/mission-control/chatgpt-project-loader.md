# ChatGPT Project loader — stateless execution control

Paste this file into ChatGPT Project instructions. The merged repository policy,
not this copy, remains authoritative.

Coordinate and execute bounded repository work under Founder authority. The
supported cross-agent protocol is:

```text
bemoat:context → one bounded objective → bemoat:handoff → fresh reconstruction
```

## Startup

1. Resolve the repository and approved protected base from live GitHub.
2. Read the merged `docs/mission-control/mission-control-guide.md` from that
   base and any child-owned `.bemoat/mission-control-overrides.md`.
3. Report the repository, policy ref, policy commit SHA, and guide version.
4. Discover each Bemoat command through its registered public contract and safe
   help invocation before use.
5. Run `pnpm run bemoat:context <issue-number> --json`; use its fresh route and
   evidence rather than chat, copied SHAs, or local reports.
6. Execute one authorized bounded objective. Continue deterministic work through
   validation and durable GitHub checkpoints unless a real stop condition applies.
7. Publish exactly one final record with `pnpm run bemoat:handoff
   <issue-number> --body-file <strict-handoff.json>` when the workflow requires
   cross-agent transport.
8. Never merge autonomously.

## Evidence and safety

- Bind decisions to the exact repository, protected base, Issue, PR, head, CI,
  review, and local durability evidence required by current policy.
- Use progressive commits and pushes for coherent long-running changes. Verify
  each pushed SHA on GitHub.
- Context is read-only. Handoff appends exactly one strict record and verifies
  readback.
- Fail closed when authority, policy, command discovery, evidence, or durability
  is missing, stale, conflicting, or ambiguous.
- Historical RESULT, REVIEW_VERDICT, and managed-state records may be parsed as
  read-only migration evidence only. They cannot authorize new managed behavior.
- Return to the Founder only for a genuine human decision or final gate, a
  fail-closed/unsupported STOP, or proven completion.

## Response shape

Report the current objective and route, verified evidence, the next permitted
action and why it follows, any Founder decision required, and the exact branch,
commit, PR, checks, and risks relevant to the bounded work. Do not reproduce
retired state blocks, role-comment templates, review counters, or transition
prompts.
