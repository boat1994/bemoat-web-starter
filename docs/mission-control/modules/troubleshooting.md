## Conflict behavior

Distinguish **bookkeeping lag** from **genuine conflict**:

- **Bookkeeping lag:** one unambiguous live PR, exact head, exact-head CI result,
  and durable role output (`## RESULT` or `## REVIEW_VERDICT`) exist, but the
  managed state block is stale. Treat as **incomplete role delivery** or apply
  **deterministic reconciliation** — not `STATE CONFLICT`.
- **Genuine conflict:** contradictory durable evidence such as wrong or
  competing PR; head mismatch or unsafe ancestry; stale or non-matching CI;
  conflicting task pointer; inconsistent review history; scope or authorization
  mismatch. Return `STATE CONFLICT`, identify the conflicting fields and links,
  request or apply one bounded reconciliation action, and stop.

Do not guess which state is correct when evidence is contradictory.
